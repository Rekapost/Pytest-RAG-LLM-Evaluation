For proof, You can cross check with other tutorials if they cover Jira youtube etc,, WHAT MAKES THIS COURSE BEST? * We assume that students have no experience in automation/coding and start every topic from scratch and basics. Examples are taken from TESTING REAL TIME HOSTED Rest APIs to understand how different components can be automated, that will give you idea of industry level framework and give you confidence. NO PRIOR CODING OR AUTOMATION EXPERIENCE NEEDED, this course covers all the necessary topics. Get more than 30 hours of unique content with real example code files provided to refer and learn with examples. Course is prepared on utmost care of picking real world scenarios what actually industry does in testing the REST API's and they were neatly delivered with every basic concept till framework building level On course completion You will be Mastered in REST API Automation and can implement Successfully it in your work place or will surely land on High Paying Job We start from Beginners level and go through Advanced FRAMEWORK level. This is a single course for everything you need to know related to Rest API Manual testing and Automation. This course explains : What is REST API's? Understanding the REST API architecture Terminologies such as Endpoint, Resources,Payload,Parameters What is POSTMAN? How to test API's with Postman? Different type of REST requests What is REST ASSured? Setting up REST ASSURED environment for automation Discussion on google API's for automation REST Assured methods REST Assured validations Methods to validate Json and xpath responses Optimizing scripts to Framwork standards Discussion on JIRA API's Discussion on Twitter API's Understanding OAUTH authentication POJO Classes usage Serialization & Deserialization for Json inputs and outputs Tons of examples on automating API's with rest assured validations Logging feature to log responses Migrating project to TESTNG framework Building Maven setup as build management tool Creating BAT file to run whole project on single click At the end of this course you can pick any REST API over Net and can automate it comfortably with all necessary valdiations Happy Testing and Wish you Good luck!",
